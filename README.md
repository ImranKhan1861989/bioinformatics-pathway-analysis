# Bioinformatics Analysis Toolkit

## Overview

The **Bioinformatics Analysis Toolkit** provides Python scripts for analyzing high-throughput genomic data, specifically focusing on RNA-seq, pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction networks. This toolkit aims to assist researchers in identifying therapeutic targets and understanding biological pathways related to cancer research.

## Scripts

### 1. `analyze_rna_seq.py`

Performs differential expression analysis on RNA-seq data to identify significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

**Usage:**
```bash
python analyze_rna_seq.py --input <input_file> --output <output_file>

Dependencies:

pandas
numpy
scipy
statsmodels
2. pathway_analysis.py
Conducts pathway enrichment analysis using the gseapy library to identify significant biological pathways.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python pathway_analysis.py
Dependencies:

gseapy
pandas
numpy
3. network_analysis.py
Analyzes protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to identify key nodes based on centrality measures.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python network_analysis.py
Dependencies:

networkx
pandas
matplotlib
Installation
To use these scripts, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scipy statsmodels gseapy networkx matplotlib
Getting Started
Prepare Your Data: Ensure your input data files are formatted correctly as required by each script.
Run the Scripts: Use the command-line instructions provided for each script to perform the analyses.
Review Results: Check the output files for results or printed output for insights.
Example
For RNA-seq data analysis:

bash
Copy code
python analyze_rna_seq.py --input rna_seq_data.csv --output significant_genes.csv
This command will generate a CSV file with significant differentially expressed genes.
