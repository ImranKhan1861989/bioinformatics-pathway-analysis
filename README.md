# Bioinformatics Analysis Toolkit

## Overview

The **Bioinformatics Analysis Toolkit** provides Python scripts for analyzing high-throughput genomic data, specifically focusing on RNA-seq, pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction networks. This toolkit aims to assist researchers in identifying therapeutic targets and understanding biological pathways related to cancer research.

## Scripts

### 1. `analyze_rna_seq.py`

Performs differential expression analysis on RNA-seq data to identify significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

**Usage:**
```bash
python analyze_rna_seq.py --input <input_file> --output <output_file>
