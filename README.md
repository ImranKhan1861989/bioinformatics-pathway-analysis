Analysis Guide
Overview
This document provides guidance on how to use the Python scripts for analyzing large datasets in bioinformatics, specifically for identifying therapeutic targets in cancer research.

Scripts
1. analyze_rna_seq.py
This script performs differential expression analysis on RNA-seq data. It takes an input file with gene expression counts and outputs a file with significant differentially expressed genes.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python analyze_rna_seq.py --input <input_file> --output <output_file>
Description:

--input: Path to the input RNA-seq data file (CSV format).
--output: Path to the output file where significant genes will be saved.
Dependencies:

pandas
numpy
scipy
statsmodels
2. pathway_analysis.py
This script performs pathway enrichment analysis using the gseapy library. It takes gene expression data and performs pathway analysis to identify significant biological pathways.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python pathway_analysis.py
Description:

This script reads a CSV file named gene_expression_data.csv containing gene expression data.
It performs enrichment analysis using KEGG pathways and saves results in the directory pathway_analysis_results.
Dependencies:

gseapy
pandas
numpy
3. network_analysis.py
This script analyzes a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to identify key nodes based on centrality measures. It uses the networkx library to compute and visualize centrality measures.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python network_analysis.py
Description:

This script reads a tab-separated file named ppi_network.txt containing PPI data.
It computes degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality measures.
The network is visualized and top therapeutic targets are identified based on degree centrality.
Dependencies:

networkx
pandas
matplotlib
Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
scipy
statsmodels
gseapy
networkx
matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scipy statsmodels gseapy networkx matplotlib
Getting Started
Prepare Your Data: Ensure your input data files are in the correct format as required by the scripts.
Run the Scripts: Use the command-line instructions provided under each script section to execute the scripts.
Review Results: Check the output files or printed results to interpret the findings.
Example
For example, if you have RNA-seq data in rna_seq_data.csv, you can run:

bash
Copy code
python analyze_rna_seq.py --input rna_seq_data.csv --output significant_genes.csv
This will generate a file named significant_genes.csv containing the differentially expressed genes.
