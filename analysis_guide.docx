# Analysis Guide

## Overview

This document provides guidance on how to use the Python scripts for analyzing large datasets in bioinformatics, specifically for identifying therapeutic targets in cancer research.

## Scripts

### 1. `analyze_rna_seq.py`

This script performs differential expression analysis on RNA-seq data. It takes an input file with gene expression counts and outputs a file with significant differentially expressed genes.

**Usage:**
```bash
python analyze_rna_seq.py --input <input_file> --output <output_file>
